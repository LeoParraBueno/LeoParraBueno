Hi, I'm @LeoParraBueno an electronic engineer with professional experience formulating and executing technological projects that involve software and/or hardware.

Within my technical skills are embedded systems development using:
- 8 bits MCU's architecture (PIC y Arduino)
- 32 bits MCU's architecture as ARM Cortex M (PSoC, STM32F103C8T6 y TM4C123GH6PM), between other SoCs (ESP8266) 

All above coding in C/C++ language. Also, I've had the opportunity to work in web development using Angular 8+, backend development using PHP, MySQL database modelling and administration, mobile apps development with IONIC, PCB and prototype design using CAD tools, networking, industrial process automation with PLC's, WSN and IoT systems implementation; engineering projects planning and management applying PMI or SCRUM.

I'm currently learning IoT and C++ in deep and want to learn python ML and IA.

I'm interested in all about electronics, IoT and embedded systems development.
